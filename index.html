      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! I am Joseph Lodato, a full-time student at Syracuse University. During the 2025/2026 school year, I will
        be in my senior year pursuing a BS in Computer Engineering as well as a minor in Physics. I am involved in
        multiple organizations on campus
        with my primary one being Citrus Racing, SU's premier motorsports design and build team, which I am the Chief
        Engineer of (more
        about my
        activities and projects below).
        <br>
        I fill my free time with photography of all kinds, while I focus on photographing deep sky objects
        (DSOs) like nebulae, supernovae, and other
        galaxies through my astrophotography; you will also find traditional photography in my gallery located below.

              <h3>Smart Copy Machine</h3>
              <p>
                Designed & built a gantry-style pen plotter utilizing stepper motors, driver chips, cameras, and
                computer vision all running or controlled with a Raspberry Pi 4B+ to scan and replicate hand drawn
                images
                by processing images into a series of
                coordinate-based motor commands.
              </p>

              <img src="/media/Projects/JuniorDesignDemoTable.jpg" alt="juniorDesign">
              <h4>Hardware Overview: </h4>
              <p>
                For the hardware side there are three axes to deal with. X and Y are the motion of the pen. While the Z
                axis
                is
                the up and down motion of the draw plate (whiteboard).
                The X and Y axes have one stepper motor per axis that is connected via belt to a carriage allowing it to
                move along linear rails.
                The Z axis is controlled by two stepper motors that raise and lower via a screw mechanism.
              </p>
              <h4>Software Overview: </h4>
              <p>
                When the user is done drawing their image, the camera captures a frame that begins the image processing
                script. In this script the image runs through some basic image processing and is skeletonized leaving
                contours that get converted into XY coordinates for the motors to follow. We used Bresenham's algorithm
                for smooth diagonal movements.

                Once the coordinates are found they are put into a list creating a path that the pen can follow and
                includes 'breakpoints' allowing for the pen needs to get picked up from the whiteboard if drawing
                disconnected lines. These coordinates are turned into motor movement by pulsing GPIO pins sending step
                counts and direction data to the MP6500 Driver Chips.

              <h3>Search and Rescue Robot</h3>
              <p>
                The end goal of a robotics programming lab I took in the spring of 2025 was to program a search and
                rescue
                robot to autonomously navigate an unknown environment to find 'victims' (paper blocks), pick them up and
                carry them back to the starting location. My team and I (myself and two others) lovingly named our robot
                "Alfred". The core of Alfred is a Rock Pi running ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) Iron with additional
                MCUs, Gyroscopes, a USB camera, two motors and wheels, a two-joint arm, etc.

              <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Autonomous Navigation:</strong> Alfred's main feature is his ability
                to navigate
                through rooms, around desks, and through doors. This was done by creating and exporting a map of the
                rooms he searched in Blender then placing AprilTags around the room for localization. A fixed search
                path
                was provided to Alfred to follow but if something was in the way, or if Alfred drifted off course
                onboard
                pathfinding systems would calculate a path for him. </li>

              <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>'Victim' (Box) Detection and Retrieval:</strong> The boxes Alfred
                was
                searching for
                had AprilTags on them allowing Alfred to find them with his camera. Once the box position pose is found,
                Alfred postions himself in order to pick up the box with his arm.</li>

              <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Return to Home:</strong> After finding and picking up a box, Alfred
                would use his
                localization and path finding systems to return to his starting position, then drop off the box before
                starting his search for a box again.</li>

              <h3>Custom Keyboard PCB</h3>
              <p>
                As a personal project, I designed and built a fully custom mechanical keyboard PCB using KiCad. The
                keyboard was inspired by the "Nullbits NIBBLE" keyboard which I loved. A 65% keyboard kit they send you
                to
                solder and assemble yourself. After that keyboard eventually died due to a crack in the PCB that caused
                a
                trace to disconnect, I decided to design my own PCB from scratch with exactly all the features I wanted.
                <br>
                Some of the main features of this keyboard include both USB-C and Bluetooth connectivity, three fully
                programmable rotary encoders, four programmable macros, and some other features all on a custom '70ish%'
                layout I made
                myself.
              </p>

              <img src="/media/Projects/keyboardPCB.png" alt="keyboard">

              <h4>Key Features:</h4>
              <li style="text-align: left;">
                <strong>USB-C and Bluetooth Connectivity:</strong> The keyboard can be used wired with a USB-C cable or
                wirelessly via
                Bluetooth at the flick of a switch. Having Bluetooth connectivity means there is also a rechargeable
                battery on the PCB which should provide up to 5 hours of battery life. Battery charging circuitry is
                from
                the MCU I chose, the Nice!Nano V2
              </li>

              <li style="text-align: left;">
                <strong>Rotary Encoders and Macros:</strong> There are three rotary encoders on the left side keyboard.
                I
                plan on using one
                for main volume control while the other two can be for volume control of specific apps. Four Macros are
                found on the right side of the keyboard, and can be programmed to do anything via the keyboard firmware
                I
                am using, ZMK
              </li>

              <li style="text-align: left;">
                <strong>Other Features: </strong>The keyboard also has RGB underglow lighting, a small programmable I2C
                OLED screen to
                display useful info. It also includes a TRRS port I can use to connect expansion boards in the future if
                I
                want to add more features (Like a dedicated numpad). The port has four conductors in it, two of which
                are
                for
                i2c data, while the other two for 5V and GND lines.
              </li>

              <li style="text-align: left;">
                <strong>MCU and Firmware: </strong>As mentioned the MCU I am using is the Nice!Nano V2, it allows for
                seamless Bluetooth
                and wired connection. For firmware I am using, ZMK, allows for full programmability of all keys and
                features of the keyboard.

              <h3>"Aperture Analysis"</h3>
              <p>
                This was the capstone for my Computational Physics Independent Study, I did at Syracuse University in
                the
                fall of 2024. This project explored the relationship between diffraction spike patterns in stellar
                images
                and the shape of a telescope's mirror or lens aperture. The goal was to reconstruct the aperture
                geometry
                of an optical system by analyzing diffraction spikes in images of stars taken with that system.

                The project involved developing a C++ program that used a custom Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and
                Inverse
                FFT (IFFT) implementation to analyze the frequency components of the stellar images and to isolate the
                diffraction spike patterns in the fequency domain. The program was then able to use the diffraction
                spike angles to calculate and
                reconstruct the aperture shape.
              </p>

              <h4>Key Features:</h4>
              <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Custom FFT and IFFT Implementation:</strong> A custom Fast Fourier
                Transform (FFT) and Inverse FFT (IFFT) algorithm was implemented in C++ to analyze the frequency
                components of stellar images. This allowed for the isolation of diffraction spike patterns from the
                images.

              </li>
              <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Diffraction Spike Analysis:</strong> The program analyzed the angles
                and intensities of the diffraction spikes in the stellar images. This data was used to infer the
                geometry
                of the telescope's aperture.
              </li>
              <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Aperture Reconstruction/Visualization:</strong> Once the Aperture
                was
                reconstructed, the data was piped into a Python script where
                it was visualized using Python's Matplotlib library to create a 2D representation of the aperture shape
                to
                display to the user.

              <h3>Celestial Veil</h3>
              <p>Over the summer of 2024, I worked to refine my ability to tackle complex programming challenges.
                Taking
                inspiration from
                Sebastian Lague and his solar system project in particular, I set off to recreate a physically
                accurate
                solar
                system in the
                Unity Game Engine using C#. This is part of a larger plan I have of developing and publishing a
                video
                game
                named Celestial Veil
                with this solar
                system being the playable environment for it.</p>

              <img src="/media/CelestialVeil.png" alt="Celestial Veil">

              <h4>Physically Accurate Orbital Mechanics</h4>
              <li style="text-align: left;">By far the biggest challenge was programming physically accurate orbits.
                After
                some research I was able to implement
                a N-body Simulation in C#. This is done by applying forces to each orbital body based on Newton's law
                of
                universal gravitation.
                This project taught me a lot about the limits of accuracy with computers as well as how to deal with
                issues such as floating
                point precision errors.</li>

              <h4>Next up: Atmospheres</h4>
              <li style="text-align: left;">With orbital mechanics added, I am now focusing on the simulation of
                atmospheric effects for all of the
                planets due to physically accurate atmospheric scattering. Updates will be coming soon!</li>

                write JavaScript code for the backend webserver to deal with connections through HTTPS with
                multithreading, I had never
                learned or applied much HTML and CSS to make webpages themselves.</p>

                brushing off some JavaScript skills to create webpages to display both my professional and photography
                portfolio.</li>
